abstract: High Mountain Asia (HMA) plays a crucial role in Asian hydrology—its vast
  snow and glacier-covered landscape significantly influences downstream river water
  supply for billions of people. Understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of river
  discharge in HMA aids effective water resource management and infrastructure planning.
  In this study, we used a combination of hydrologic modeling and assimilation of
  remotely sensed discharge from Landsat and PlanetScope imagery to investigate how
  daily river discharge has changed for more than 114,000 reaches across HMA between
  2004 and 2019. We observed significant increasing trends in river discharge for
  11,113 reaches (∼10%), particularly in smaller rivers of the Syr Darya, Indus, Yangtze,
  and Yellow River basins. The ratio of total glacial melt and precipitation received
  by individual river reach showed an average significant increase of 2.2% per year,
  particularly in the Syr Darya, Amu Darya and Western Indus rivers. Across HMA, our
  results also indicate that 8% of river reaches with either planned and existing
  hydropower plants or dams experienced a statistically significant average increase
  of 2.9% per year in stream power. These findings illustrate the rapidly changing
  patterns of river discharge and stream power in HMA.
